EXAMPLE 2 CHAIN OF THOUGHT:     
Eligible_conditions just specify neoplasms, which is a synonym for cancer. The trial eligibility criteria are more specific about cancer type, so do not return any search terms for Neoplasm.
The trial eligibility criteria specify solid tumors, which is a cancer type, so return at least three terms, including Solid Neoplasm as a minimum.
Gastrointestinal tumours are also mentioned as a cancer type so include terms for this too. Gastrointestinal cancer could relate to any part of the digestive system.
The criteria also specify non-endometrial cancer, which means that endometrial cancer is excluded. Since the task is to return search terms regardless of whether included or excluded, return at least three terms for this as well. 
The eligibility specify several genetic alterations and molecular dysfunctions - dMMR (which means mismatch repair deficiency - we will include terms related to mutations in the genes responsible so that this can be linked to alterations in the patient), MSI-H (which means high-frequency microsatellite instability), POLE_mut (which means mutation in the POLE gene)
