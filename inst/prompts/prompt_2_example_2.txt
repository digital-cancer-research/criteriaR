EXAMPLE 2 CHAIN OF THOUGHT: 
The trial condition name values lists several eligible cancer types for the trial overall, and the eligibility criteria and design group descriptions specify more detail about eligibility for individual design groups. 
14 design groups are listed for the trial.  

The presence of a solid malignant tumour is stated as a general requirement. 

For Module 2 Part A1 no additional criteria are listed so only C9292: Solid Neoplasm will be used
For Module 2 Part A2 no additional criteria are listed so only C9292: Solid Neoplasm will be used
For Module 2 Part B1 patient must have C4004: Gastric Adenocarcinoma and alteration C40459: ATM Gene Mutation
For Module 2 Part B2 patient must have C4004: Gastric Adenocarcinoma but ATM proficient i.e. not alteration C40459: ATM Gene Mutation
For Module 2 Part B3 patient must have C4872: Breast Carcinoma. HER2 Negative is not included as an allowed alteration
For Module 2 Part B4 patient must have C71732: Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma 
For Module 3 Part A patient must have C2926: Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma or C34447: Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, no specific requirement listed for Part A
For Module 3 Part B patient must have C2926: Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma or C34447: Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, no specific requirement listed for Part B
For Module 2 Part B5 patient must have any of the alterations C179406: BRCA Gene Mutation or C131480: RAD51C Gene Mutation or C131481: RAD51D Gene Mutation or C101641: PALB2 Gene Mutation or C133695: Homologous Recombination Repair Gene Mutation. Since no cancer type is mentioned. C9292: Solid Neoplasm will be used as condition requirement
For Module 4 (FE/QT) patient must have C9292: Solid Neoplasm but not C4004: Gastric Adenocarcinoma or C9296: Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma or C4025: Esophageal Adenocarcinoma or C2955 Colorectal Carcinoma. 
For Module 5 Part A patient condition must be any of C3867: Fallopian Tube Carcinoma, C40022: Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma or C4908: Ovarian Carcinoma
For Module 5 Part B patient condition must be any of C3867: Fallopian Tube Carcinoma, C40022: Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma or C4908: Ovarian Carcinoma, and patient must have any of the alterations C179406: BRCA Gene Mutation or C131480: RAD51C Gene Mutation or C131481: RAD51D Gene Mutation or C101641: PALB2 Gene Mutation or C133695: Homologous Recombination Repair Gene Mutation. 
For Module 1 Part A no additional criteria are listed so only C9292: Solid Neoplasm will be used
For Module 1 Part B no additional criteria are listed so only C9292: Solid Neoplasm will be used
  
  
There are additional requirements regarding e.g. disease status and prior treatments but these will not be included in the expression as they are not features of the patient object to be tested.
There is no indication that any design group is closed to recruitment, so return a value of NA for dg_status for each design group.
