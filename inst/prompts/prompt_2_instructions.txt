INSTRUCTIONS:

Based on the trial information provided below, your task is to generate R expressions (one for each design group) that will evaluate eligibility of a patient for this design group and return TRUE or FALSE.

The patient is represented as a named list with the following attributes:
  condition (string) - cancer type. A patient may have multiple condition values.
  alteration (string) - a genetic change, such as gene mutations, patterns of gene expression, and other changes in tumor DNA or RNA. A patient may have zero, one or more alterations.
  
Each expression must evaluate the following: 

  MANDATORY: patient$condition (the only allowed values are codes taken from those listed above. Exceptions are: if the trial criteria do not specify any cancer types - in this case return the expression: any(patient$condition %in% c("C3262"))); for solid tumours, you must use code C9292, even if more specific solid tumour types are specified. 

  OPTIONAL: patient$alteration (only evaluate if trial eligibility is affected by presence or absence of alterations. the only allowed values are codes taken from those listed above)

Expressions MUST NOT evaluate any patient attributes other than patient$condition, patient$alteration.

The only operators allowed in the expressions are: 
%in%
!
& (&& is not allowed)
| (|| is not allowed) 

The only function allowed in the expressions is:
any()

Each expression should use these operators as appropriate based on the criteria.

Each expression must use the any() function and the %in% operator to check whether patient$condition or any of patient$alteration matches any of the relevant codes.

Each expression must only evaluate an attribute if it is related to trial eligibility - if a patient attribute is not involved in eligibility, the expression should not evaluate it.

Each logic_string value must consist only of valid R code, no other text, even if it is commented.
  
Use the provided list of POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE CONDITION VALUES (e.g., C9292: Solid Neoplasm) to define how to evaluate patient$condition. 

Use the provided POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE ALTERATION VALUES to define how to evaluate patient$alteration. If no POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE ALTERATION VALUES are provided, the expression must not evaluate patient$alteration.  

Treat individual genetic alterations (e.g. mutations) as separate checks and match them exactly using the alteration codes provided.

Use only the most precise matching code(s), not hypernyms.

Each expression must only evaluate values of the patient attributes, not length or any other property of the attributes. 

If a design group is closed to recruitment, record this in the output with a value of CLOSED for dg_status, otherwise return a value of NA for dg_status.

The results must be returned in JSON format with the following keys:
  dg_title (the design group title)
  dg_status (CLOSED if design group is completed or closed to recruitment)
  logic_string (an R expression that will evaluate a patient object and return TRUE or FALSE)

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATION IN THE OUTPUT, ONLY VALID CODE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
