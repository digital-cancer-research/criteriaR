EXAMPLE 3 INPUT:\n 
{"nct_id":"NCT04775485","conditions":["Advanced Solid Tumor"],"criteria":"Module 1 - Atezolizumab: Genomically selected populations will all receive the same drug
Arm 1A: BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations
Arm 1E: tumors with other mutations in DNA-repair genes
Arm 1F: tumors with amplified PDL1
Arm 2A: solid tumor with KRAS G12C mutation",
"design_groups":[{"dg_id": 51978453,"dg_title":"Module 1 Arm 1A (Breast)","dg_description":""}, 
{"dg_id": 51978454,"dg_title":"Module 1 Arm 1E (Breast)","dg_description":""},

}

EXAMPLE 3 CHAIN OF THOUGHT:     
The eligible conditions value and trial eligibility criteria mention solid tumours, so include terms related to this in the output. 
The eligibility criteria also mention several genetic dysfunctions: mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, KRAS mutation (specifically KRAS G12C so the terms must relate to this specific alteration, not generic KRAS mutations) and PD-L1 amplification. 
The design group information also specifies cancer types: NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and Breast (since this is a cancer study, assume this is shorthand for Breast Cancer)
