{"nct_id":"NCT04775485","conditions":["Breast Cancer"],"criteria":"Inclusion Criteria:
If pre/perimenopausal women and men treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy beginning at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1
Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast that is locally advanced or metastatic and is not amenable to surgical or radiation therapy with curative intent
Documented HR +/ HER2- tumor according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines
Confirmation of biomarker eligibility: detection of specified mutation(s) of PIK3CA via specified test
Disease progression after or during treatment with a combination of CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy: <= 2 prior lines of systemic therapy in mBC setting; CDK4/6i based therapy does not need to be the last one received prior study entry; one line of chemotherapy in mBC setting allowed
Measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)
Participants for whom endocrine-based therapy is recommended and treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy is not indicated at time of entry into the study, as per national or local treatment guidelines
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2
Life expectancy of > 6 months

EXAMPLE 1 CHAIN OF THOUGHT:     
The only value for eligible_conditions is Breast Cancer, so return three comma-separated strings as search terms. 
The trial eliigbility criteria mention adenocarcinoma of the breast, which is a cancer type, so return at least three comma-separated strings as search terms. 
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy is a treatment, metastatic and locally advanced are related to disease status so ignore these terms. 
The following relate to gene or molecular dysfunctions, so return at least three comma-separated search terms for each: HR+ (which means hormone receptor positive), HER2- (which means Her2/Neu negative) and PIK3CA mutation.
