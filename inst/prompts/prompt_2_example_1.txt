EXAMPLE 1 CHAIN OF THOUGHT: the trial mentions eligibility for prostate cancer patients and head and neck cancer patients. This is consistent with the values specified for condition name for this trial. The trial has a single design group with id 51682614. The expression should evaluate patient$condition and patient$age. For prostate cancer, The criteria do not require adenocarcinoma specifically, so C4863 is the correct term to use. For head and neck patients, the criteria do not require squamous cell carcinoma specifically, so C4013 is the correct term to use.
There is no indication that the design group is closed to recruitment, so return NA for dg_status.
